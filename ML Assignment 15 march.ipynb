    "##### Q7: How can unsupervised learning be used in anomaly detection?\n",
    "##### Ans:- Anomaly detection also known as outlier detection is the process of finding data points within a dataset that differs from the rest. Common applications of anomaly detection includes fraud detection in financial transactions, fault detection and predictive maintenance. Broadly speaking, anomaly detection can be categorized into supervised and unsupervised realm. Supervised anomaly detection requires labelled dataset that indicates if a record is “normal” or “abnormal”. Unsupervised anomaly detection involves an unlabeled dataset. It assumes that the majority data points in the unlabeled dataset are “normal” and it looks for data points that differs from the “normal” data points. In this article, we will be using Pycaret for detecting anomalies. Pycaret is an Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) tool that can be used for both supervised and unsupervised learning."
