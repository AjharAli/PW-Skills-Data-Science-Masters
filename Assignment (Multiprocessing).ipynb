    "##### Q1. What is multiprocessing in python? Why is it useful?\n",
    "##### Ans- Multiprocessing in Python is a built-in package that allows the system to run multiple processes simultaneously. It will enable the breaking of applications into smaller threads that can run independently. It is useful because the multiprocessing package offers both local and remote concurrency, effectively side-stepping the Global Interpreter Lock by using subprocesses instead of threads."

    "##### Ans- The Python Multiprocessing Pool class allows you to create and manage process pools in Python. Although the Multiprocessing Pool has been available in Python for a long time, it is not widely used, perhaps because of misunderstandings of the capabilities and limitations of Processes and Threads in Python. Python multiprocessing Pool can be used for parallel execution of a function across multiple input values, distributing the input data across processes (data parallelism). Below is a simple. "
